Partial views and layouts.

Advanced Topics:
Using Tag Helpers for form elements.

Asynchronous programming with Razor Pages.
Integrating Entity Framework Core for data access.

Project Structure:
Models: Define the data structure.
Data: Setup the application’s database context.
Pages: Create Razor Pages for CRUD operations.
Services: Use a repository pattern to abstract data access logic.
